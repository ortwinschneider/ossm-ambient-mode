Explore OpenShift Service Mesh - Ambient Mode, based on Istio service mesh without sidecars.

== About this workshop

This is a hands-on lab/workshop focused on OpenShift Service Mesh Ambient Mode — a modern service mesh approach on Red Hat OpenShift based on Istio’s ambient mode architecture. 

NOTE: Ambient mode lets you operate a service mesh without injecting sidecar proxies into every workload, instead using a lightweight per-node proxy (ztunnel) and optional Layer-7 proxies called waypoints — reducing overhead and simplifying adoption.

The content is structured as sequential modules that guide you through **setup, observability, tracing, deploying workloads, traffic management, resilience features, and security policies**.

This workshop is mainly for **cloud-native platform engineers, DevOps teams, developers and SREs** who are:

- Deploying or managing service meshes on Red Hat OpenShift.
- Interested in learning about ambient mode as an alternative to traditional sidecar-based Istio service mesh.
- Wanting to learn how to observe, secure, trace, and manage traffic in a sidecar-less environment.
- Hands-on practitioners who can access an OpenShift cluster and execute the lab steps.
- It assumes familiarity with Kubernetes/OpenShift fundamentals and service mesh concepts before diving into the hands-on modules.
