== About Ambient Mode

Istio ambient mode introduces a new way to manage service mesh without using traditional sidecar proxies. The biggest change is how it separates network traffic processing into two distinct layers, which is the core architectural difference. This architecture simplifies networking, reduces resource usage, and improves security while supporting the same service mesh use cases.

Ambient mode uses a different data plane architecture that splits traffic processing between a per-node Layer 4 (L4) proxy called Ztunnel (Zero-Trust Tunnel) and an optional Layer 7 (L7) proxy called waypoint proxy.

Ambient Mode also exclusively uses the Kubernetes Gateway API (using Gateway, HTTPRoute, TCPRoute) for its traffic configuration, moving away from Istio's legacy VirtualService and DestinationRule for L7 routing.
